Study Bro – Terms of Service & Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 01.09.2025

Welcome to Study Bro, an AI-powered study assistant application. By creating an account or using Study Bro, you agree to the following Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (“Terms”). Please read these terms carefully. They explain how our app works, how we handle your data, and the rules for using the service. If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use the app.

1. Acceptance of Terms
    •    Consent to Terms: By registering an account or otherwise accessing Study Bro, you confirm that you have read and agree to these Terms. You will be required to affirmatively accept these Terms (for example, by checking a box) when creating an account.
    •    Updates to Terms: We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify users (for example, via email or an in-app alert). Continued use of the app after updated Terms are posted constitutes acceptance of the changes.
    •    Account Responsibility: You agree to provide accurate information when creating your account and keep your login credentials secure. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account. If you suspect any unauthorized use of your account, notify us immediately at ldinichert@gmail.com.

2. Eligibility and Age Restrictions
    •    Minimum Age: You must be at least 13 years old to use Study Bro. The app is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13.
    •    Users Under 16: While Study Bro’s content is designed to be free of explicit or sensitive material, if you are under 16 years old, you should use the app only with a parent or guardian’s consent and supervision. We consider a parent/guardian responsible for monitoring and guiding the use of Study Bro by anyone under 16. In other words, even though we strive to keep content safe for all ages, the involvement of a parent/guardian is required for younger users to ensure appropriate use and understanding of the app.
    •    Parental Responsibility Disclaimer: We have implemented filters and safety measures to prevent inappropriate content from being shown or generated by the app. However, no automated system is perfect. Study Bro is not liable for any content a minor may encounter. By allowing a child to use the app, the parent or guardian acknowledges that they understand the app’s functionality and agree to supervise the child’s use. If you as a parent or guardian see any concerning content, please contact us.

3. Account Registration and Data Collected

To use Study Bro, you will create an account either by signing up with an email and password or by using a supported third-party login (Apple or Google). During registration and use of the app, we collect certain information from you:
    •    Personal Information: First Name, Last Name, Username, Date of Birth, Profile Picture, Email Address, and Password. This information is used to create and personalize your account, allow you to log in, and enable core features like identifying you to your friends within the app. For instance, your username (and optionally profile picture) will be visible to friends you add on the app.
    •    Study Preferences: We also ask for your preferred study subjects or topics. Providing this is optional, but if you do, we use it to tailor the study content and AI assistance to your interests (for example, focusing practice questions on subjects you’re interested in).
    •    Non-Sensitive Data: We intentionally do not collect sensitive personal data such as government ID numbers, health information, biometric data, or financial information (except as needed for payment processing, discussed later). The personal details we collect are basic account information. We ask that you do not input any sensitive personal information into the app or the AI chat, as the app is not designed to process or store such sensitive data.
    •    Camera Usage (Document Scanning): If you use the built-in study document scanner, the app will request access to your device camera. This is only used for the purpose of allowing you to scan study materials (e.g. textbook pages or notes) into the app. We do not record video or use the camera in the background; it is only activated when you choose to scan a document. The scanned images or text are saved to your account so you can use them within the app (for example, to generate flashcards or ask the AI questions about the scanned material). Scanned documents are treated as your private content – they are not shared with other users (no one else can see your scans) and are stored securely (see “Data Storage” below). We do not manually review or moderate your scanned content, since it remains private to you, so you are solely responsible for what you scan. Make sure you only scan documents that you have the right to use (see Section 7 on User Content).
    •    Usage Data: Like most apps, we may collect some usage information automatically when you use Study Bro. This includes technical data such as device type, OS version, and general usage metrics (e.g. feature usage, timestamps of log-ins, etc.). This data helps us improve the app experience (for example, by understanding which features are most used) and ensure stability and security of the service. We do not use this data to profile you for advertising, and we do not collect any precise location data or unnecessary device information.

Data Use: The personal data you provide is used strictly to operate and improve Study Bro’s services. For example, your email is used for account verification and for sending necessary communications (password resets, important account notices). Your name or username is used to personalize your experience and to display to any friends you add. Your birthdate helps us ensure compliance with age requirements and may be used to show age-appropriate content if relevant. Any preferences or study-related data you give help tailor the app’s AI recommendations to you. We do not use your personal information for any purpose outside of providing and enhancing the Study Bro service.

4. Data Storage, Security, and Retention
    •    Firebase Cloud Storage: All user data (including your profile information, preferences, study content, AI conversation history, and scanned documents) is stored securely in our database and storage provided by Google Firebase. Firebase is a reputable cloud platform by Google that offers robust security measures. Google Firebase services are ISO 27001 certified and comply with industry-standard security practices ￼. Your data is transmitted to and stored on Google’s servers, which may be located outside of Switzerland (primarily in data centers in the European Union or the United States). However, Google has committed to maintaining compliance with European and Swiss data protection frameworks for international data transfer ￼. In particular, Google certifies adherence to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework principles for the transfer and protection of personal data ￼. This means that your data is handled with a high level of care and legal protection even if processed abroad.
    •    Security Measures: We take data security seriously. Firebase automatically encrypts data in transit and at rest. Access to the database is restricted by authentication and industry-standard security rules. We also restrict access to your data on our side – only authorized personnel (the Study Bro team Léonard Dinichert and Alexey Zdobnov) can access the database, and even then only for legitimate maintenance or support needs. We will never access your private content (like your notes or conversation history) unless it’s necessary to troubleshoot an issue you reported or required by law.
    •    Retention Period: By default, we retain your data indefinitely while you have an active Study Bro account. There is no automatic deletion after a set time – we keep your data so that your study history and content remain available to you each time you use the app. If you wish to remove your data, you have the right to delete your account at any time. Upon account deletion, we will delete or anonymize your personal data from our systems. Specifically, deleting your account triggers the deletion of your user record and all associated content (notes, scans, chat history) from our Firebase database. Backup copies maintained by Firebase will also be purged in accordance with Google’s standard retention policy – generally, data is fully removed from backups within about 180 days after deletion ￼. This means once you delete your account, your data will no longer be accessible through the app, and it will be permanently erased from all live and backup storage within roughly six months.
    •    No Data Export Feature (at this time): Currently, Study Bro does not provide an automated data export or download feature. This means you cannot automatically download all your study data or chat history from within the app interface. We’re a small team and haven’t built this functionality yet. However, you still own your data. If you need a copy of certain important information, you may contact us at ldinichert@gmail.com, and we will do our best to assist (for example, we can manually retrieve certain data for you, consistent with your rights under applicable law). In the future, we plan to add user-friendly data export options.
    •    Data Accuracy and Updates: You can review and edit personal details like your name, email, or preferences in your account settings. It’s your responsibility to keep your account information up-to-date. If you need any assistance updating or correcting information that you cannot change yourself, you can reach out to support.
    •    Account Deletion: If you decide to stop using Study Bro, you can delete your account from within the app settings or by contacting us. Be aware that deletion is permanent – we will not be able to recover your data once it’s removed. If you merely uninstall the app or stop using it without deleting your account, your data will remain stored (since we retain data until an account is actively deleted). We do this so that if you return to the app, your progress and content will still be there. If you want your data gone, make sure to formally delete your account or send us a deletion request.

5. Friends Feature and Social Interaction

Study Bro includes an optional “Friends” feature to help motivate and connect with others. This feature is entirely opt-in – you can use the core study features of the app without ever adding friends. Here’s how it works and what information is (and isn’t) shared:
    •    Friend Requests: To become friends with someone on Study Bro, one of you must send a friend invite and the other must accept. Both users must mutually agree to be friends. There is no way for a stranger to automatically become your friend or see your data without your explicit approval. You are in control of who is on your friends list. If at any point you no longer want to be connected, you can remove or block a friend.
    •    Visible Information to Friends: If you do add friends, the only information friends can see about each other in the app is a limited set of data meant to encourage friendly competition and accountability. Specifically, friends can see your username (or the display name you’ve chosen), possibly your profile picture (if you uploaded one, as an avatar in the friends list), and some study activity indicators such as your current study streak and general app usage stats. A “streak” typically means the number of consecutive days you have met a study goal or used the app. “App usage activity” might include indicators like when you were last active or how many study sessions you’ve completed this week. We do not show your friends any of your private study content (they cannot see your notes, scanned documents, or chat history with the AI, etc.). They also cannot see personal details like your full name, email, or birthdate. It’s basically a gamified scoreboard among friends – e.g., a friend might see “User123 – 5 day streak – Active today” in their friends list.
    •    No Public Posting: Study Bro is not a social media platform. There is no public feed or public content sharing within the app. Everything you create (notes, AI conversations, etc.) is private to your account, unless you choose to manually share something outside the app (for example, copying an AI-generated answer and posting it on your blog – which you are allowed to do; see Section 7 on content sharing rights). Within the app, the only social aspect is the friends leaderboard type information described above.
    •    No Messaging: Importantly, Study Bro does not have a messaging system or chat between users. You cannot send personal messages or files to friends in-app. The friends feature is limited to viewing each other’s study progress stats. If you want to communicate with a friend, you’ll have to use external means. This also means there’s no user-generated content visible to others that would require moderation (e.g., no user forums, no public comments). This helps us keep the environment focused and safe.
    •    Acceptable Use in Social Features: Even though the interaction is minimal, we expect users to still behave respectfully. Do not attempt to use offensive usernames or harass others through friend requests. If someone does manage to act inappropriately (e.g., by choosing an obscene username), we reserve the right to take action (such as forcing a username change or banning the user) to keep Study Bro a friendly study environment. You can report any issues to ldinichert@gmail.com.

6. Payments, Subscriptions, and Refunds

Study Bro is offered on a freemium model. This means core features are free to use, but we also offer a premium subscription (Study Bro Pro) that unlocks additional features and content for advanced studying.
    •    Free Version: All users have access to the free tier of Study Bro. The free version includes basic AI assistance and some limited number of daily queries or limited functionality (for example, perhaps a certain number of questions you can ask the AI per day, or basic flashcard generation). We have these limits to manage server costs and also to encourage upgrading for power users, but we ensure that the free version remains useful on its own for casual studying.
    •    Premium Subscription: Our premium offering is an optional paid subscription which provides an enhanced experience – for example, unlimited AI interactions, advanced study analytics, priority access to new features, etc. The exact benefits will be described in the app at the time of purchase. The subscription is auto-renewing (typical subscription model on App Store/Play Store or via our website). This means if you sign up, you will be charged periodically (monthly or annually, depending on the plan you choose) until you cancel. We make this clear during the purchase flow as well.
    •    Payment Processing: Payments for subscriptions are handled securely by third-party platforms. If you subscribe on iOS (Apple) or Android (Google Play), the transaction is handled by Apple or Google respectively through your App Store account. If we offer subscriptions via a web interface, those payments are handled by Stripe, a leading payment processor. We do not ever see or store your full credit card numbers or payment credentials. For example, when you pay through Stripe, your card information is transmitted directly from your device to Stripe over an encrypted connection; we receive a token from Stripe to confirm payment and possibly the last four digits of your card for record-keeping, but not the full card number or security code (this design is part of Stripe’s PCI-compliant system where merchants don’t get the sensitive card data). In fact, Stripe ensures that businesses using their service cannot see your full card number or CVC; they only provide us with necessary information like a transaction ID and card type (and last4) ￼. Stripe also has a strict privacy policy and does not sell your financial information to third parties ￼.
    •    Subscription Terms: When you subscribe, you are charged upfront for the chosen billing period. Subscriptions auto-renew at the end of each period (e.g., monthly or yearly) by charging the same payment method you provided. You can cancel the auto-renewal at any time. If you cancel, you will still retain access to premium features for the remainder of the period you’ve paid for, but your subscription will not renew for the next period. For example, if you bought a one-month subscription on January 1 and cancel on January 15, you’ll keep premium access until January 31 but won’t be charged in February.
    •    No Refund Policy: All purchases are final. We generally do not offer refunds for subscription fees that have already been charged. For instance, if you forgot to cancel and the subscription renewed, we do not automatically refund that charge. We provide in-app reminders and easy cancellation to try to prevent this scenario. That said, you can always reach out to ldinichert@gmail.com if you have extenuating circumstances, and we will review on a case-by-case basis (especially if mandated by platform rules or local consumer laws). But our default stance is no refunds for used subscription time. If you cancel, you won’t be charged again, but the current period is not prorated or refunded.
    •    Price Changes: We reserve the right to change the pricing of the subscription or introduce new pricing tiers. If you are an existing subscriber and the price is increasing, we will notify you and generally the new price will apply from your next billing cycle (giving you a chance to cancel if you don’t agree with the new price).
    •    Failed Payments: If a subscription payment fails (e.g., card expiration or insufficient funds), you might lose access to premium features unless you update your payment information promptly. We may attempt to retry the charge a few times or notify you to update info.
    •    Stripe & Platform Terms: By making a purchase, you also agree to comply with the terms and conditions of the payment provider (e.g., Apple Media Services Terms for App Store, Google Play Terms, or Stripe’s services terms if paying by credit card on web). These providers are responsible for processing your payment and have their own privacy and security practices. We only share necessary information with them (for example, we tell Stripe how much to charge and for what, and Stripe tells us if payment was successful). Your billing information is handled by those providers and subject to their privacy policies.

7. User Content and Intellectual Property

This section explains what rights you have regarding the content you put into Study Bro and what rights we have for the app’s content and software.
    •    Your Content: “Your Content” refers to any material that you input, upload, or create while using Study Bro. This includes text you type into the app (for example, questions you ask the AI, or notes you write), documents or images you scan into the app, and any outputs the AI generates for you (AI-generated answers, summaries, flashcards, etc.). You retain ownership of Your Content. If you wrote it or provided it, it’s yours. We do not claim any ownership over the original materials you provide or the personalized outputs created for you.
    •    Right to Use Your Content: By using the app, you grant us a license to process and store Your Content for the purpose of operating the service. For example, when you input a question or document, you give us permission to store it on our servers and to feed it into our AI model to generate a response. We only use your content to provide the service back to you. We are not using your study notes or questions to train some public AI model, and we don’t display your content to other users (except as needed for the friend stats discussed). Essentially, you’re saying “here is my content, Study Bro can analyze it and send me back results and save it for my later access.” This license is necessary for the technical functioning of the app, and it ends when you delete the content or delete your account (at which point we no longer have the rights to keep it, and we remove it from our systems).
    •    User Content Privacy: As mentioned, anything you input is private to your account. We do not have a public forum where content is posted. We do not review user-uploaded content unless absolutely required (for example, if you contact support and ask for help with something that might involve looking at a specific document or conversation, and you give us permission, we might access that data to assist you). Our team is small and we’re frankly too busy to snoop even if we wanted to. If, by some rare circumstance, we become aware of content that is blatantly illegal (say someone is storing illicit material), we reserve the right to remove it and potentially report it to authorities, consistent with law – but otherwise, your study materials are your business, not ours.
    •    User Responsibility for Content: You are responsible for all content that you upload or create on Study Bro. This means you should only upload documents that you have the right to use. By scanning or inputting any material, you are confirming that you either own that material or have obtained any necessary permissions to use it. For example, if you upload pages from a textbook, make sure it’s for your personal study and within fair use – don’t upload an entire copyrighted book with the intent to redistribute it. While we don’t share your uploads with others, you still could be liable if you misuse someone else’s intellectual property. We will not be held responsible for user-uploaded content; the user who added it bears all responsibility ￼. If someone complains that content you stored infringes their rights, we may remove it and notify you.
    •    Sharing of AI-Generated Content: One of the cool things about Study Bro is that the AI can generate helpful notes, answers, or study materials for you. We want you to benefit from these freely. You are allowed to copy, export, or share any content the AI generates for you. For instance, if the AI helps you write a summary and you want to share that summary with your classmates, that’s completely fine. We do not claim copyright over the AI’s output. Legally speaking, AI-generated text might not qualify for copyright at all, or if it does, we assign any rights to you as the user. That said, we recommend you use discretion and ethics in sharing. If the AI wrote an essay for you, and you turn it in for a class assignment, make sure that’s within your school’s honor code (we don’t condone academic dishonesty). If you share AI-generated content publicly, it’s a good practice to fact-check it and maybe even mention it was AI-assisted (to be transparent), but that’s up to you. We simply disclaim that we aren’t responsible for what happens with content after you share it outside the app.
    •    App Content and Intellectual Property: Apart from Your Content, all other elements of the Study Bro app are our intellectual property (or that of our licensors). This includes the app’s code, design, logos, graphics, and the curated content within the app (for example, any built-in study guides or questions we wrote ourselves). Study Bro (the app and brand) is not open-source software – it’s proprietary. You are not granted any rights to our source code or assets. You agree not to copy, distribute, modify, or reverse engineer any part of the app. Basically, you have a license to use the app for its intended purpose, but you don’t own the app or its components. You also can’t use our trademarks (the name “Study Bro”, our logos, etc.) without permission.
    •    AI Model and Content: The AI model that powers Study Bro is hosted on Hugging Face (more on that in the next section). Any AI responses are generated by our custom model. Those responses might contain factual information, which isn’t “owned” by anyone, or they might be based on common knowledge or public data. To the extent an AI-generated response includes portions of copyrighted text (which shouldn’t generally happen unless your input included it), we advise you to treat it carefully. In general, assume that anything the AI provides that looks like a creative work (an article, a translation, etc.) is intended for your personal use and learning. If you plan to publish it verbatim, consider potential copyright or attribution implications. When in doubt, use the AI output as a guide or reference and put things in your own words.

8. AI Services and Disclaimers

Study Bro uses artificial intelligence to provide study tips, answer questions, and assist you in learning. It’s important to understand the nature and limitations of this AI feature:
    •    AI Provider (Hugging Face): Our AI functionality is powered by a custom AI model that we host on Hugging Face, which is an AI service platform. When you ask a question or have a conversation with the Study Bro AI, your query is sent to our model running on Hugging Face’s servers. The model processes it and returns a response, which we then display to you. By using the AI feature, you acknowledge that your inputs are being processed by a third-party service (Hugging Face) on our behalf. Hugging Face is a reputable company and has its own Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that govern the use of their platform ￼ ￼. Notably, Hugging Face’s terms state that they will not sell or rent your personal information ￼, and we do not provide them with any more of your data than necessary (essentially, just the text of your queries and the context needed for the model to respond). We do not send them your account details or other personal info attached to those queries. Nonetheless, if you are uncomfortable with this, you should refrain from using the AI chat feature. Using the rest of the app (like manual note-taking or scanning) does not involve Hugging Face.
    •    AI is Not a Human or a Professional: The Study Bro assistant may feel conversational and knowledgeable, but it is not a real person. It does not have genuine understanding or intentions – it’s generating responses based on patterns in data. Do not take the AI’s responses as professional advice. The AI might give study tips or explanations on academic topics, but it is not a certified teacher or tutor, and certainly not a lawyer, doctor, or other professional. Any content provided by the AI is for informational and educational purposes only. It is not a substitute for professional advice or individualized instruction ￼. For example, if the AI gives you psychological advice on handling study stress, remember it’s not a licensed counselor. Always use your own judgment and, when appropriate, consult a qualified professional or teacher for serious matters.
    •    Quality and Accuracy of AI Responses: We strive to make the AI as helpful and accurate as possible, but AI can sometimes be wrong or misleading. You may encounter answers that are incorrect, incomplete, or out-of-date. The AI might also occasionally fail to understand your question or give irrelevant output. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any AI-generated content ￼. The information the AI provides might help you study, but you should independently verify important facts or answers before relying on them ￼. For instance, if the AI helps solve a math problem, double-check the solution; if it summarizes a historical event, consider cross-checking with your textbook. Using the AI is meant to supplement your learning, not replace traditional learning resources. Fact-checking is encouraged – ultimately, you are responsible for how you use the AI’s output ￼.
    •    No Sensitive or Private Queries: Please do not use Study Bro’s AI for private or sensitive matters. The AI is designed for study-related questions, not for personal counseling or confidential data. You should not share personal identifiable information (like your address, phone number, passwords) with the AI. Even though we don’t intend to misuse anything you input, AI queries are processed on external servers (Hugging Face), and the responses might be logged for service quality. Treat the AI a bit like a public resource – if you wouldn’t post the content of your question on a public forum, you probably shouldn’t input it into an AI. In short, Study Bro is not meant for discussing private, sensitive information or secrets. It’s a study tool, not a secure diary or encrypted chat.
    •    Content Safety: We have implemented content filters to try to prevent the AI from producing offensive or inappropriate content. For example, it should refuse or sanitize requests that are hateful, extremely violent, or sexually explicit. However, these filters are automated and might not catch everything. If you encounter any AI output that is offensive or unsafe, we apologize and ask that you report it to ldinichert@gmail.com so we can improve the system. Similarly, do not attempt to trick or cajole the AI into generating disallowed content. That violates these Terms. We reserve the right to suspend users who abuse the AI in this way (for instance, trying to get it to produce hate speech or other prohibited material). Keep your usage constructive and educational.
    •    No Guarantee of Outcomes: Using the AI or any part of Study Bro may help you learn, but we do not guarantee any specific outcomes. For example, we can’t promise that using Study Bro will improve your grades, help you pass a test, or achieve any particular academic goal. Those outcomes depend on many factors (your effort, how you use the tool, etc.) beyond our control. The app is a tool to assist you, but it’s not magic. You agree that you won’t hold us responsible if your academic performance does not improve or if you’re unsatisfied with any results after using the app.
    •    AI Usage Policies: In addition to our Terms, by using the AI (which involves Hugging Face), you are subject to Hugging Face’s usage policies. Hugging Face has a Content Policy that prohibits misuse of their services (for example, using the AI for illicit behavior, generating very inappropriate content, etc.). While as a user you interact just with us, we flow down these requirements. That means you should not use the AI in any manner that would violate Hugging Face’s rules or any applicable law. We may terminate or suspend your access to the AI feature if we believe your usage is in violation of these policies or is excessively abusive (technically or content-wise). This is to protect both you and the platform.

9. Third-Party Services and Integrations

Study Bro relies on a couple of third-party services to function. We want to be transparent about these and how they involve your data:
    •    Google Firebase: As noted, our backend (database, storage, authentication, etc.) runs on Google Firebase. By using Study Bro, your data is being stored on Google’s servers via Firebase. Google’s Firebase Terms of Service and Privacy Policy apply to the handling of data on their platform. Google is a data processor for us, meaning they handle your data on our behalf. They are contractually obligated to protect your data and only use it for providing the Firebase services. Google does not use your Firebase-hosted data for any advertising purposes; in fact, Firebase is part of Google Cloud, which has strict privacy commitments (Google states that customer data in Cloud services is not used for any ad targeting). Google also maintains that it will not sell your data. They use it only to fulfill the service (and for maintaining and improving Firebase itself). For more details, you can refer to Google Firebase’s privacy information. Firebase also allows us to implement certain security rules (which we have, to restrict data access on a need-to-know basis). If you want to know more, Google provides an overview of Privacy and Security in Firebase ￼ ￼, which includes how data is stored, secured, and how you can request deletion. In summary, we trust Firebase as a secure solution for our app’s data needs, and by using Study Bro you consent to your data being handled by Google in this manner.
    •    Stripe: For payment processing (if you subscribe via our website or any mechanism outside the app stores), we use Stripe, Inc. When you provide payment details, those details go directly to Stripe. Stripe may collect identifying information about you and your payment method (like name, billing address, card info). That info is primarily used to process your subscription payments and to comply with anti-fraud and legal requirements. Stripe is PCI-DSS compliant, which is a strict security standard for handling payment data. We (Study Bro) do not store your credit card number or CVC at all. Stripe acts as the intermediary. They might share back with us a token or ID for the transaction, confirmation of payment, and possibly some limited info like card brand and expiration (so we can show “Visa ending in 1234” in your account billing section, for example). All of this is normal for online payments. By paying, you agree to Stripe’s terms (which you can find on their website) and you acknowledge that Stripe will process your payment data. Stripe will not sell your financial data to third parties ￼. They only share it with banks or necessary parties to complete the transaction, or as required for services you consent to. If you have concerns about how Stripe handles data, please review Stripe’s Privacy Policy ￼.
    •    Hugging Face: As described in the AI section, we use Hugging Face to host our AI model. Hugging Face may temporarily log certain data (like API requests) for monitoring and improving their service. They have their own privacy commitments and do not rent or sell personal info ￼. We do not send your personal account identifiers in the API calls; however, note that the content of your AI queries could potentially include personal data if you include it in your question. So again, don’t put private data in there. Hugging Face’s systems will see the text of your question to generate an answer, but not, say, that it’s user John Doe asking it. They process it and send back the answer. Hugging Face also has usage policies (no hate, etc.) which we adhere to. They might perform automated checks or filtering on content (for example, to block hate speech generation). By using the AI, you agree to allow this processing. If you want to read Hugging Face’s full Terms or Privacy Policy for more insight, they are available on their website ￼.
    •    Analytics: At this time, we have not integrated any third-party analytics or advertising SDKs that track users (like Google Analytics or similar). If that ever changes, we will update this policy. Our focus is on protecting student privacy, so we keep third-party tracking to a minimum. We might use Firebase’s built-in analytics in anonymized form to see aggregated usage patterns, but that doesn’t involve sharing your personal info beyond Google which is already the host.
    •    Stripe & Firebase Data Transfers: Since both Firebase and Stripe are U.S.-based companies, using these services might involve transferring your data outside of Switzerland to the United States. As mentioned, Google (Firebase) complies with the EU/Swiss-U.S. privacy frameworks to safeguard such transfers ￼. Stripe similarly has commitments under GDPR and other laws for international transfer (they use standard contractual clauses, etc.). By using the app and its payment features, you consent to these international data transfers as needed for service provision. We will always strive to ensure any third-party we use has adequate data protection measures in place.
    •    No Third-Party Marketing: We do not share your personal data with any third-party for advertising or marketing purposes. You will not suddenly get spam emails or marketing calls because you signed up for Study Bro. The third-parties we integrate with (Firebase, Stripe, Hugging Face) are all service providers, not ad networks. They only use data as outlined (to run the app, process payments, power the AI).
    •    Changes in Providers: If in the future we add or change a significant third-party integration that affects your data, we will update these terms and notify you if required.

10. Acceptable Use Policy

When using Study Bro, you must follow these rules. They’re mostly common sense and courtesy:
    •    Lawful Purposes Only: You agree to use Study Bro in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Do not use the app to engage in any illegal activities. This includes, for example, not using the AI to facilitate cheating in a way that violates exam rules, not uploading truly illicit content, etc. If it’s illegal in the offline world, it’s illegal on Study Bro too.
    •    No Hacking or Disruption: Do not attempt to interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the app or its related systems. This means no attempting to hack our servers, no introducing malware, no spamming the app with automated requests, and no attempting to access other users’ accounts or data. If you try to break or abuse the service, we may terminate your access and possibly pursue legal remedies if it’s serious.
    •    Respect Privacy and IP: Do not use Study Bro to violate anyone’s privacy or intellectual property rights. For instance, don’t upload content that contains personal data of others without permission. Don’t scan and distribute someone else’s private letters or a whole copyrighted book. While what you do with your content privately is your business, using our service to store or manipulate content that clearly infringes on others’ rights (and especially if someone complains to us about it) is not allowed.
    •    No Misuse of AI: As mentioned, don’t intentionally prompt the AI to produce disallowed content (hate speech, explicit sexual content involving minors, instructions for wrongdoing, etc.). Also, don’t use the AI to impersonate real people or spread misinformation deliberately. If we detect such misuse, we may warn or suspend you. Remember that all AI usage is indirectly subject to Hugging Face’s content rules which we enforce.
    •    One Account per Person: Please don’t make multiple accounts to circumvent usage limits or bans. If we have a free daily limit, don’t make 5 accounts to get 5x the free usage – this violates the spirit of fairness. Also, do not share accounts. Your account is for your use; if someone else (like a sibling or friend) wants to use Study Bro, they should create their own account (they can use the free tier or get a sub if they want).
    •    Community Conduct: Although our social features are limited, any interaction you have (like choosing a username, adding friends) should be done in a respectful manner. Don’t choose a username that is offensive, racist, or otherwise against common decency. If we see such usernames, we may change or remove them. When sending friend requests, only do so to people you actually know or who have agreed to connect; don’t spam random users (although currently, you’d have to know someone’s username to friend them, so it’s somewhat self-limited).
    •    Feedback and Reverse Engineering: We love feedback about the app, but you agree not to misuse any feedback or knowledge of the app to compete unfairly. Specifically, you should not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the app, nor create derivative services based on our app without permission. Also, while you can certainly tell others about Study Bro, you shouldn’t falsely imply you’re associated with us or that we endorse you in some way without consent.

If you violate any of the above rules, we reserve the right to take action, which may include a warning, content removal, or immediate termination of your account depending on the severity. Serious violations (like illegal activities) could be reported to law enforcement.

11. Disclaimers of Warranties

We want to be clear that Study Bro is provided as a service to help you, but we can’t make absolute promises that it will always be perfect or fit your needs. By using Study Bro, you understand and agree to the following disclaimers:
    •    “As Is” Service: Study Bro is provided to you “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE,” without warranties of any kind ￼. This means we do not guarantee that the app will meet all your expectations or purposes, nor that it will be error-free or uninterrupted. While we strive to maintain high uptime and quickly fix bugs, we do not warrant that the software will be free of defects, vulnerabilities, or that it will work 100% of the time. Use it at your own discretion and risk.
    •    No Guaranteed Results: We make no guarantee that using Study Bro will yield any particular outcome (academic or otherwise). For example, we can’t promise you’ll ace your exams because you used our flashcards or that the AI will solve every homework problem correctly. Any success stories are anecdotal; individual results will vary.
    •    Accuracy of Information: We do not warrant the accuracy or completeness of any information obtained through Study Bro, whether that information comes from the AI, from our own provided content, or from user materials ￼. While we do our best to ensure quality, there may be mistakes. The AI might occasionally generate incorrect statements. Our own study tips might not apply perfectly to your situation. Always double-check critical information from multiple sources.
    •    Fitness for Purpose: We disclaim any implied warranties of fitness for a particular purpose or merchantability. For instance, if you use Study Bro for a purpose it isn’t designed for (say, as a general notebook or for a subject we don’t support well), we aren’t responsible if it doesn’t work the way you wanted. We design it primarily for educational study assistance.
    •    Third-Party Services: We don’t control the third-party services (Firebase, Stripe, Hugging Face), so we can’t guarantee those will function perfectly at all times either. There might be outages or changes on their end that impact the app. We of course will do all we can to maintain service (and we have chosen reliable providers), but we aren’t liable for downtime or data loss caused by third-party failures.
    •    Translations: The app and these Terms might be available in multiple languages (such as Spanish, French, German, Russian) for the convenience of users. These translations are generated or assisted by AI and may not be fully accurate. The original language of these Terms is English, and the English version is the official binding version. Any translations are provided “as is” for convenience, with no guarantee of accuracy or reliability ￼ ￼. In the event of any discrepancy or conflict between a translated version and the English version of the Terms, the English version prevails ￼. We are not liable for misunderstandings or errors in translation. If something is unclear, please refer to the English text or contact us for clarification.
    •    No Professional Advice: To reiterate from the AI section – any advice or information (e.g. study advice, health tips for stress) you obtain through Study Bro, whether from AI or any other feature, is not professional advice. You should not act on it as if it were professional guidance. Always consider consulting a qualified professional for advice on legal, medical, mental health, or other professional matters. We are not liable for any decisions you make based on information from the app, which is educational in nature ￼.
    •    Beta Features: If we roll out experimental or beta features (we might label them as such in the app), those are even more “as is.” They might be unstable or changed/removed without notice. Use beta features with caution, and understand your data or experience with them might not be as smooth.

12. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Study Bro and its creators (Léonard Dinichert and Alexey Zdobnov) will not be liable for any damages or losses arising from your use of the app. This includes:
    •    Indirect or Consequential Damages: We are not responsible for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages. For example, we won’t cover things like lost profits, loss of data, or costs of procuring substitute services resulting from any issue with Study Bro ￼. If the app malfunctions and you lose some study notes, or if an incorrect AI answer somehow causes you to make a mistake that costs you money or a grade, we’re deeply sorry, but we are not legally liable for those outcomes.
    •    Direct Damages Cap: If, despite the above, we are found liable for any claim arising from these Terms or the use of Study Bro, our liability will be limited to at most the amount you paid us in the last 6 months (and if you have paid nothing, then a nominal amount like $0 or CHF0). In other words, our financial responsibility to any user is capped. We’re a small operation and cannot take on unlimited liability.
    •    Specific Situations: We are not liable for any failure or delay in performance of our obligations (like providing the service) if it’s due to causes beyond our reasonable control – for instance, an internet outage, war, natural disaster, acts of government, or other force majeure events.
    •    Use of the App: You assume full responsibility for any decisions you make based on information provided by Study Bro. If you rely on an answer from the AI and it turns out wrong, you assume the risk of that. If you use the app in a way that breaks your device or consumes your data plan (unlikely, but just saying), that’s also not on us. Always use reasonable discretion and caution.
    •    Third-Party Disputes: Any disputes you have with third-party providers (e.g., a payment issue with Apple/Google or Stripe, or something with your internet provider) are between you and that third party. Although we will try to assist or mediate if it’s something within our power (like contacting Stripe on your behalf), we aren’t liable for their actions.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation/exclusion of liability for certain damages. If laws applicable to you prohibit any of these limitations, then to that extent, those limitations would not apply to you. But all other limitations and exclusions will still apply. Our intent is to limit our liability to the maximum extent the law permits.

13. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Study Bro, its owners (which are the individuals managing it, Léonard Dinichert and Alexey Zdobnov), and any affiliates or partners, from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) that arise from: (a) your use of the app, (b) your violation of these Terms, or (c) your violation of any rights of a third party (for example, if you upload content that infringes someone’s copyright and they sue us, you’ll indemnify us for that). Essentially, if your actions cause us legal trouble or loss, you agree to cover our costs. We will notify you of any such claim and cooperate reasonably in any defense, but we reserve the right to handle it if you aren’t doing so in a timely manner.

14. Termination of Service
    •    By You: You are free to stop using Study Bro at any time. If you want to permanently terminate your account, you can do so in-app or by contacting us (as described in Section 4 on account deletion). Terminating your account will remove your access to the app and trigger deletion of your data as explained.
    •    By Us: We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to Study Bro (including any subscription access) at our discretion if we believe you have violated these Terms or pose a risk to the community or service. We might do this without prior notice if the circumstances warrant (for example, a severe violation like hacking attempts). In most cases of minor violations, we’ll try to warn you first and work it out. If we terminate your account due to violation of terms, you may lose access to your data (we may retain it as needed for legal reasons or evidence of the violation), and you will not be entitled to any refunds for any remaining subscription period (as the termination was for cause).
    •    Effect of Termination: Upon termination by either party, these Terms effectively end as an agreement between you and us, except for sections that naturally survive termination. All provisions concerning intellectual property, disclaimers, liability, and indemnification survive termination. This means even if you stop using the app or your account is deleted/banned, you still can’t, for example, disclose our trade secrets, and we still disclaim warranties, etc., as allowed. If we terminate the service entirely (i.e., shut down Study Bro for everyone), we will make an effort to notify users in advance and provide a way to export any important data if possible.

15. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
    •    Swiss Law: These Terms and any dispute arising from them or the use of Study Bro will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Switzerland. We specifically operate under the laws of the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland. However, the Swiss federal laws on data protection and obligations also apply. If you are using the app from another country, be aware that you are still agreeing that Swiss law governs our relationship (to the extent not overridden by any mandatory laws of your country, such as consumer protection rules that cannot be waived).
    •    Jurisdiction: In the event of any dispute or claim between us that cannot be resolved amicably, the courts located in Geneva, Switzerland will have jurisdiction. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts for litigating such disputes. This usually will only matter if something serious comes up; we hope to resolve any issues informally or through mediation/arbitration if possible.
    •    Complaints and Dispute Resolution: If you have any issues or disputes with Study Bro, we encourage you to contact us first and attempt to resolve it informally. We’re reasonable people and will try our best to address your concerns. In the EU (though Switzerland is not EU, it often mirrors some processes) there are often provisions for alternative dispute resolution; while not strictly required here, we’re open to discussing arbitration or mediation if both parties agree. Otherwise, formal legal action would proceed in Geneva courts.

16. Miscellaneous
    •    No Professional Advice (Further Emphasis): We’ve said it before but it bears repeating one last time: Study Bro does not offer professional or expert advice. It’s a study aid. Always use critical thinking and don’t rely solely on the app for important decisions ￼. If the app’s content ever conflicts with what your teacher taught or what’s in official materials, double-check rather than taking the app as authoritative.
    •    Not a Substitute for Human Educators: Study Bro is here to complement your studying, not replace teachers, tutors, or mentors. Keep engaging with real educators and sources for a well-rounded learning experience.
    •    Entire Agreement: These Terms (along with any additional policies referenced, such as our Privacy commitments within and any platform-specific terms) constitute the entire agreement between you and Study Bro regarding the use of the service. They supersede any prior understandings or communications.
    •    Severability: If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful or unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severed from the Terms and will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which will remain in full force.
    •    No Waiver: If we don’t enforce a part of these Terms at any given time, it doesn’t mean we waive our right to enforce it later. For example, if you violate a rule and we don’t immediately act, we’re not giving up any rights to act on future or past violations.
    •    Assignment: You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our written consent. We may transfer our rights and obligations (for example, if ownership of the app changes, or if we outsource operations) to another party, but we will notify you if that happens and ensure the terms remain protective of your rights.
    •    Contact and Identity: Study Bro is an application developed and managed by Léonard Dinichert and Alexey Zdobnov (the “Study Bro Team”). As of now, Study Bro is not registered as a separate legal business entity; it is an app/service operated by the two individuals above. For privacy inquiries or any questions about these Terms, you can contact us at ldinichert@gmail.com. If postal correspondence is needed, our place of operation is Geneva, Switzerland.
    •    User Support: If you encounter any issues, bugs, or have feedback, please reach out via ldinichert@gmail.com or through our in-app support channel. We aim to respond promptly and help you out. Your feedback is valuable as we continue to improve Study Bro.
    •    Consent to Privacy Policy: By using the app, you also consent to the practices outlined in this document regarding how we collect, use, and protect your data. We have combined the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy for ease of reading, but if you have any privacy-specific questions, don’t hesitate to ask. We want you to feel safe and informed using Study Bro.

17. Final Notes and Disclaimers
    •    No Warranty: To wrap up, we want to clearly state that we make no warranties or representations other than what is explicitly stated in these Terms. The app is a work in progress and provided in good faith to help students, but it comes with no guaranteed warranty. We disclaim any implied warranties to the extent allowed by law.
    •    Liability Limit Recap: Our liability to users is limited as described above. We are not liable for how you use the app or what results from it, beyond the extent of the law.
    •    Changes to Service: We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the app at any time (for example, discontinue a feature, or shut down the service temporarily for maintenance) with or without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason the app is unavailable at any time or for any period.
    •    Acknowledgment: By creating an account or using Study Bro, you acknowledge that you have read these Terms, understand them, and agree to be bound by them. If you are a parent or guardian of a minor who is using the app, you acknowledge that you have reviewed these terms with the minor and accept responsibility for compliance.

Thank you for reading through this comprehensive document! We know it’s lengthy, but we believe in transparency and ensuring our users know exactly what to expect. Our goal is to provide a helpful, safe, and innovative study tool that respects your privacy and rights. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding these Terms or Study Bro in general, please reach out at ldinichert@gmail.com.

Happy Studying with Study Bro! Remember, we’re here to bro-boost your learning experience, but you’re always in the driver’s seat of your education journey. Stay curious and good luck with your studies!
